# Customer Banking System

## Introduction
This Python project simulates a banking system that includes the creation and management of savings and CD accounts. Users can calculate the interest earned based on the account balance, interest rate, and duration, and then update the account balance accordingly.
## Features
- **Savings Account Management**: Create a savings account, calculate interest over a period, update the balance, and retrieve the new balance and interest earned.
- **CD Account Management**: Similar functionalities are implemented for a CD account, with parameters suitable for such accounts.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Users interact with the system through the command line, entering account details and viewing computed interest and updated balances.

## How to Use
1. **Starting the System**: Run the `customer_banking.py` file.
2. **Create and Manage Savings Account**:
    - Enter the initial balance, annual percentage rate (APR), and the duration in months.
    - View the updated balance and interest earned.
3. **Create and Manage CD Account**:
    - Similar steps to the savings account, tailored for CD accounts.
4. **Output**: For each account, the system displays the interest earned and the new balance, formatted to two decimal places.
